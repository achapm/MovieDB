This is a demo using the AngularJS framework, Bootstrap Sass for styling, Gulp for rapid development and Bower for  package management. It consumes the themoviedb.org API as a service to provide search results. It will also create  a distributable build with all CSS and JS concatenated and minified through Gulp.
